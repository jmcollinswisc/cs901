	abstract = {Insurance affects the variability of consumption over time, which is not captured in standard expected utility of wealth models. We develop a consumption-utility model that shows how liquidity constraints and borrowing costs impact the value of insurance. Liquidity constraints generate high insurance demand when premiums are due smoothly, sometimes leading to seemingly dominated choices. Conversely, a risk-averse person may value insurance below its expected value and appear risk loving when premiums are due in a single payment. Moreover, optimal insurance contracts take different forms with liquidity constraints. We show empirical insurance analysis using the standard model can generate misleading counterfactuals and welfare estimates. Finally, we demonstrate the model’s feasibility and importance with an application to evaluating cost-sharing reductions on the health insurance exchanges.},

            Measuring consumer responsiveness to medical care prices is a central issue in health economics and a key ingredient in the optimal design and regulation of health insurance markets. We leverage a natural experiment at a large self-insured firm that required all of its employees to switch from an insurance plan that provided free health care to a nonlinear, high-deductible plan. The switch caused a spending reduction between 11.8\% and 13.8\% of total firm-wide health spending. We decompose this spending reduction into the components of (i) consumer price shopping, (ii) quantity reductions, and (iii) quantity substitutions and find that spending reductions are entirely due to outright reductions in quantity. We find no evidence of consumers learning to price shop after two years in high-deductible coverage. Consumers reduce quantities across the spectrum of health care services, including potentially valuable care (e.g., preventive services) and potentially wasteful care (e.g., imaging services). To better understand these changes, we study how consumers respond to the complex structure of the high-deductible contract. Consumers respond heavily to spot prices at the time of care, reducing their spending by 42\% when under the deductible, conditional on their true expected end-of-year price and their prior year end-of-year marginal price. There is no evidence of learning to respond to the true shadow price in the second year post-switch.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear cost-sharing in health insurance encourages intertemporal substitution because patients can reduce their out-of-pocket costs by concentrating spending in years when they hit the deductible. We develop a test for intertemporal substitution and apply it to data from the RAND Health Insurance Experiment, where people were randomly assigned either to a free care plan or to a cost-sharing plan which had coinsurance up to a maximum dollar expenditure (MDE). Hitting the MDE—leading to an effective price of zero—has a bigger effect on health care demand than does being in free care, because people who hit the MDE face low current prices but high future prices, and so stock up on health care. As a result, short-lasting price changes induce nearly twice as big a response as do long-lasting changes. These ﬁndings help reconcile disparate estimates of the price elasticity of demand for health care in the existing literature. Failing to account for intertemporal substitution can lead researchers to overstate cost savings from high deductible health plans by 20\% or more.},

	abstract = {Many health care treatments are not urgent and may be delayed if patients so choose. Because insurance coverage is typically determined by the treatment date, individuals may have incentives to strategically delay treatments to minimize out-of-pocket costs. The strategic delay of treatment--a particular form of moral hazard--can be an important source of subsequent adverse selection, in which ex ante identical individuals select insurance coverage based on their differing accumulation of previously delayed treatments. This article investigates these forces empirically in the context of the missing market for dental insurance. Using rich claim-level data, my analysis reveals that approximately 40\% of individuals strategically delay dental treatments when incentivized to do so, and this flexibility in delaying treatment can explain why the market for dental insurance has largely unraveled. More generally, the counterfactual analysis suggests features such as open enrolment periods and contracting on pre-existing conditions may be helpful tools in overcoming adverse selection in insurance contexts where the timing of uncertainty is not contractible.},

By contrast, for individuals with low deductibles, there is no significant change in healthcare demand (except for prescription drugs).

	abstract = {Objective
To assess the initial impact of offering consumer-defined health plan (CDHP) options on employees.

Data Sources/Study Setting
A mail survey of 4,680 employees in the corporate offices of Humana Inc. in June 2001.

Study Design
The study was a cross-sectional mail survey of employees aged 18 and older who were eligible for health care benefits. The survey was conducted following open enrollment. The primary outcome is the choice of consumer-directed health plan or not; the secondary outcome is satisfaction with the enrollment process. Important covariates include sociodemographic characteristics (age, gender, race, educational level, exempt or nonexempt status, type of coverage), health status, health care utilization, and plan design preferences.

Data Collection Methods
A six-page questionnaire was mailed to the home of each employee, followed by a reminder postcard and two subsequent mailings to nonrespondents.

Principal Findings
The response rate was 66.2 percent. Seven percent selected one of the two new plan options. Because there were no meaningful differences between employees choosing either of the two new options, these groups were combined in multivariate analysis. A logistic regression modeled the likelihood of choosing the novel plan options. Those selecting the new plans were less likely to be black (odds ratio [OR] 0.46), less likely to have only Humana coverage (OR 0.30), and more likely to have single coverage (OR 1.77). They were less likely to have a chronic health problem (OR 0.56) and more likely to have had no recent medical visits (OR 3.21). They were more likely to believe that lowest premiums were the most important plan attribute (OR 2.89) and to think there were big differences in the premiums of available plans (OR 5.19). Employees in fair or poor health were more likely to have a difficult time during the online enrollment process. They were more likely to find the communications very helpful (OR 0.42) and the benefits information very understandable (OR 0.38). They were less likely to feel that they had enough time to make their enrollment decision (OR 0.47).

Conclusions
Employees who were attracted to the new CDHP plan options valued the attributes that distinguished these plans from other choices. The shift to consumer-defined plans and to the electronic provision of information, however, requires a significant increase in the communication support for all employees, but particularly for those in fair or poor health whose information needs are the most complex and individualized.},

To determine factors associated with selecting a high-deductible health plan (HDHP) rather than a preferred provider plan (PPO) and to examine switching and market segmentation after initial selection.

Data Sources/Study Setting
Claims and benefit information for 2005–2007 from nine employers in western Pennsylvania first offering HDHP in 2006.

Study Design
We examined plan growth over time, used logistic regression to determine factors associated with choosing an HDHP, and examined the distribution of healthy and sick members across plan types.

Data Extraction
We linked employees with their dependents to determine family-level variables. We extracted risk scores, covered charges, employee age, and employee gender from claims data. We determined census-level race, education, and income information.

Principal Findings
Health status, gender, race, and education influenced the type of individual and family policies chosen. In the second year the HDHP was offered, few employees changed plans. Risk segmentation between HDHPs and PPOs existed, but it did not increase.

Conclusions
When given a choice, those who are healthier are more likely to select an HDHP leading to risk segmentation. Risk segmentation did not increase in the second year that HDHPs were offered.},

Data Sources Adult participants in the 1997-2012 waves of the US Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) (N = 1 282 080). Study Design We conducted difference-in-differences analyses, comparing health care expenditures among EITC-eligible adults in February (immediately following EITC refund receipt) with expenditures during other months, using non-EITC-eligible individuals to difference out seasonal variation in health care expenditures. Outcomes included total out-of-pocket expenditures as well as spending on specific categories such as outpatient visits and inpatient hospitalizations. We conducted subgroup analyses to examine heterogeneity by insurance status. Principal Findings EITC refund receipt was not associated with short-term changes in total expenditures, nor any expenditure subcategories. Results were similar by insurance status and robust to numerous alternative specifications. Conclusions EITC refunds are not associated with short-term changes in health care expenditures among US adults. This may be because the refund is spent on other expenses, because of income smoothing, or because of similar refund-related variation in health care expenditures among noneligible adults. Future studies should examine whether other types of income supplementation affect health care expenditures, particularly among individuals in poverty.},

We use exogenous variation in the copayments faced by low-income enrollees in the Massachusetts Commonwealth Care program to study these effects. We estimate separate price elasticities of demand by type of service. Overall, we ﬁnd price elasticities of about −0.16 for this low-income population — similar to elasticities calculated for higher-income populations in other settings. These elasticities are somewhat smaller for the chronically sick, especially for those with asthma, diabetes, and high cholesterol. These lower elasticities are attributable to lower responsiveness to prices across all categories of service, and to some statistically insigniﬁcant increases in inpatient care.},

	abstract = {Medical expenditures represent a major financial burden that can hinder families’ ability to acquire other goods and services. How patterns of out-of-pocket medical expenditures vary across black and white households, however, remains unclear. Because blacks have poorer health than whites on average, one could assume that black households experience greater medical spending burdens than socioeconomically similar white households. Research on racial disparities in access to health services, however, suggests that blacks are less likely to receive medical care than whites with similar medical needs. Barriers to healthcare access and utilization could entail lower out-of-pocket medical spending for black households, despite their greater medical needs. Using data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey, this paper examines patterns of out-of-pocket healthcare spending for black and white households. By comparing households across socioeconomic status, insurance status, and age, we demonstrate that black households consistently spend less on medical care than white households do. These trends are consistent with pervasive barriers to healthcare access and utilization for blacks relative to whites and suggest that policy interventions aimed at alleviating health inequality should not focus on subsidies and monetary incentives alone.},

Our results suggest that the candidate mechanisms include more prenatal care and less negative health behaviors (smoking). Additionally, we find a shift from public to private insurance coverage, and for some a reduction in insurance overall, indicating a potential change in the quality and perhaps quantity of coverage.

	abstract = {The JPMorgan Chase Institute draws on its Healthcare Out-of-Pocket Spending Panel (HOSP) to investigate how a specific and important cash infusion—a tax refund payment—drives the timing of out-of-pocket expenditures on healthcare. We analyze average out-of-pocket healthcare expenditure on over a dozen categories of healthcare goods and services for each day in the 100 days before and after a tax refund payment, for 1.2 million checking account holders in the JMPCI HOSP who received a tax refund between 2014 and 2016. This represents the first ever daily event study documenting how families’ out-of-pocket healthcare spending responds to the arrival of this significant cash infusion. Our analysis uncovers five key findings illustrating that consumers’ spending on healthcare was significantly affected by cash flow dynamics. First, consumers immediately increased their total out-of-pocket healthcare spending by 60 percent in the week after receiving a tax refund. Spending remained elevated for about 75 days, during which consumers spent 20 percent more out of pocket on healthcare than before the tax refund. Second, in the week after the tax refund, out-of-pocket healthcare spending on debit cards increased by 83 percent, and electronic payments increased by 56 percent. There was no change to credit card spending. This suggests that liquidity from the tax refund enabled the increase in healthcare spending. Third in-person payments to healthcare service providers represented 62 percent of tax refund-triggered additional healthcare spending. This indicates that the timing of a cash infusion affected when consumers received healthcare, not just when they made a healthcare payment. Fourth, the tax refund caused consumers to make visits to dentists’ and doctors’ offices and pay outstanding hospital bills which they had deferred. Finally, Cash flow dynamics had less effect on the out-of-pocket healthcare spending patterns of consumers who had higher balances in their checking account or who had a credit card.},

We use two difference-in-differences comparisons over the study period 1988–1999, first comparing single mothers to single childless women, and then comparing single mothers with two or more children to single mothers with exactly one child. In both cases we find that the EITC expansions are associated with a relative decline in the unsecured debt of affected households of single mothers. While not direct evidence of a causal relationship, this is suggestive evidence that single mothers may have used part of their EITC to limit the growth of their unsecured debt during this period.},

We divide the problem into rising rates of nonresponse, imputation, and measurement error, documenting the rise in each of these threats to survey quality over the past three decades. A fundamental problem in assessing biases due to these problems in surveys is the lack of a benchmark or measure of truth, leading us to focus on the accuracy of the reporting of government transfers. We provide evidence from aggregate measures of transfer reporting as well as linked microdata. We discuss the relative importance of misreporting of program receipt and conditional amounts of benefits received, as well as some of the conjectured reasons for declining cooperation and for survey errors. We end by discussing ways to reduce the impact of the problem including the increased use of administrative data and the possibilities for combining administrative and survey data.},

We find that the payments raised the probability of an adult emergency department visit over the following 23 weeks by an average of 1.1 percent. This effect is difficult to reconcile with the Permanent Income Hypothesis. We observe little impact on avoidable hospitalizations or emergency visits for nonurgent conditions and no difference in effects as a function of health insurance coverage. By contrast, we show that the increase is driven by visits for urgent medical conditions, like drug- and alcohol-related visits. Complementary evidence suggests that consumers are not simply substituting from outpatient doctor visits to hospital care. The results thus suggest that liquidity constraints may not constitute a direct barrier to care, but rather that liquidity can increase health care utilization indirectly by increasing the need for care.},

To test for such a possibility, we study the distribution of monthly Social Security checks among Medicare Part D enrollees. When Social Security checks are distributed, prescription fills increase by 6-12 percent. In that sense, drug consumption of low-income Medicare recipients is "liquidity sensitive." We then study recipients who transition onto a program that eliminates copayments. When those recipients do not face copayments, their drug consumption becomes less liquidity sensitive. That finding implies that, beyond risk protection, generous insurance also provides recipients with the ability to consume healthcare when they need it rather than when they have cash. Further, we find that recipients whose drug consumption is most liquidity sensitive exhibit price elasticities of demand that are twice the size of the average elasticity, suggesting that more-generous insurance causes recipients both to re-time prescription filling and also to start filling prescriptions that they otherwise would not fill. We present a stylized model that uses this finding to call into question the conventional interpretation of demand-response to price as solely inefficient moral hazard.},

Based on data from a representative survey of US consumers, we find that financial readiness varies widely across consumers, with lowest-income, least-educated, unemployed, and black consumers most likely to have \$0 saved for emergency expenses. For these consumers, even a temporary financial shock, either an unexpected negative income shock (such as a layoff or a short-term government shutdown) or an unexpected expenditure (such as a medical expense or a car repair), could have severe financial consequences. The literature likely underestimates the consequences, because consumers who are not financially prepared to cover unexpected expenses are more likely to borrow on their credit cards, adding to their existing debt. Thus the cost of relying on credit cards is likely very high for consumers who are already financially vulnerable. We use panel data to examine whether consumers who experienced a substantial drop in income from one year to the next, like one resulting from a layoff or a government shutdown, increased their credit card borrowing. We do not find evidence that a negative income shock raises consumers’ likelihood of revolving on credit cards or increasing the amount borrowed.},

We find that EIC eligible households spend approximately 3 percent more total during February, the modal month of EIC refunds, and 9 percent more on durable goods than non–eligible households. The increased spending on durable goods indicates that the EIC facilitates the purchasing of big–ticket items by low–income families. These estimates, when converted to dollars, also suggest that EIC recipients smooth expenditure somewhat since the average increase in expenditure is less than the average EIC refund.},

families with very low financial assets are 23\% more likely to have unsecured debt within a 2‐year period after experiencing a new health condition
 
 
 
 
 
results from fixed effects estimations show that the onset of a new health adversity is associated with a 10\% increase in the probability of having unsecured debt and approximately 11\% increase in the amount of debt within a 2‐year period after experiencing a health problem. However, changes in the probability of having unsecured debt and in the amount of debt are not uniform across households. The effects are most evident for households with very low financial assets (the bottom decile) and for other low assets households (10th–30th percentiles of the financial assets distribution). For example, compared with their healthy counterparts in the same wealth group, families with very low financial assets are 23\% more likely to have unsecured debt within a 2‐year period after experiencing a new health condition and their debt is 30\% higher.
 
Wealthier households (higher than the 30th percentile of the financial assets distribution) do not seem to increase their debt immediately after experiencing health adversities. However, if health problems are severe, the long‐term probability of having positive debt and the debt load of these affluent households is significantly higher
 
Our findings indicate that the propensity to acquire unsecured debt in response to a health shock is higher for uninsured households or those who are covered by Medicare insurance only. Moreover, severe health conditions seem to have a lasting effect on borrowing behavior. After experiencing a severe health problem, only households with multiple insurance policies (e.g. Medicare and employer‐provided insurance) seem to maintain the same level of unsecured debt in the long‐term. },

The paper adds to previous work by: (1) estimating treatment effects on the treated using simulated EITC benefits and longitudinal data; (2) testing whether health effects vary across the three different parts of the EITC schedule; (3) examining the role of food expenditures and health insurance as potential mechanisms. The study finds that income improves the likelihood of affected heads of households reporting to be in excellent or very good health by 6.9 to 8.9 percentage points. The effects are largest in the plateau phase of the EITC schedule, where previous researchers have identified pure income effects of the program. The results are robust to several additional specifications, including a semi-parametric DD model and specifications that account for the potential endogeneity of sample. When examining potential channels underlying the relationship between income and health, I find that affected household increase their food expenditures by 10.5 to 20.3 percent and are 1.52 percent more likely to have health insurance coverage.},

This study tests whether the well-established health gradient exists once the endogeneity of income is accounted for by using expansions in the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in the mid-1990s as a source of exogenous income variation. I find that higher EITC payments lead to significant improvements in self-assessed health, while changes in food expenditures and insurance coverage are shown to be likely mechanisms underlying the relationship between income and health. 

By using data from the Panel Data of Income Dynamics (PSID) for the years 1990–2003, this study exploits the expansion of the EITC, which was part of OBRA 1993, to test for the relationship between income and health outcomes of heads of households.

We account for anticipated economic shocks through changes in macroeconomic indicators and time periods associated with the Great Recession. Using families as the unit of observation, we apply fractional response models with correlated random effects and two-part health expenditure models to assess how over a two-year period, family health care spending responds to economic shocks. Our findings indicate that income shocks to single-mother families result in an increase in the share of family health care spending consumed by children, while in two-parent families, economic shocks have little impact on the allocation of health spending between parents and children. Our findings for single-mother families are consistent with altruistic behavior by parents toward children.},

We find evidence that certain subpopulations on government cash aid significantly increase their consumption of drugs when their checks arrive at the beginning of the month, and as a result, experience adverse events including hospitalization and death. Using data from California, we find that the overall rate of drug-related hospital admissions increases abruptly at the beginning of the month, with admissions increasing 23\% during the first five days of the month. We find that this cycle is driven largely by recipients of Supplemental Security Income (SSI). SSI recipients also experience an abrupt 22\% increase in within hospital mortality after receiving their checks. These findings suggest that “full wallets” adversely affect some aid recipients, and that policymakers should explore alternate disbursement regimes such as a staggered disbursement schedule or in-kind support that have the potential to reduce the rate of adverse events.},

We find that respondents consider their tax refund as a whole, without differentiating the portion from the EITC; as a result, they cannot predict how their EITC refund would change if they altered their labor supply or marital status. Incentives for childbearing are better understood, but are not specific to the EITC; rather, parents respond to a combination of tax deductions and credits as a whole. Respondents would like to maximize their refunds, but most cannot or would not alter their behavior due to structural constraints they face in the labor and marriage markets. Rather than adjust work hours, defer marriage, or have additional children, respondents exhibit a different type of behavioral response to the incentive structure of the EITC: They alter their tax filing status in order to maximize their refunds. They routinely claim zero exemptions and deductions on their W-4s, file their tax returns as head of household rather than as married, and divide children among the tax returns of multiple caregivers. Although some of these behaviors qualify as tax noncompliance, they emerge because the intricacies of the tax code conflict with the complexity and fluidity of finances and family life in low-income households.},

Whereas higher average income is associated with better health, there is evidence that health behaviours worsen in the short-term following income receipt. Prior studies revealing such negative short-term effects of income receipt focus on specific subpopulations and examine a limited set of health outcomes.Methods: The United States Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is an income supplement tied to work, and is the largest poverty reduction programme in the USA. We utilize the fact that EITC recipients typically receive large cash transfers in the months of February, March and April, in order to examine associated changes in health outcomes that can fluctuate on a monthly basis. We examine associations with 30 outcomes in the categories of diet, food security, health behaviours, cardiovascular biomarkers, metabolic biomarkers and infection and immunity among 6925 individuals from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Survey. Our research design approximates a natural experiment, since whether individuals were sampled during treatment or non-treatment months is independent of social, demographic and health characteristics that do not vary with time.Results: There are both beneficial and detrimental short-term impacts of income receipt. Although there are detrimental impacts on metabolic factors among women, most other impacts are beneficial, including those for food security, smoking and trying to lose weight.Conclusions: The short-term impacts of EITC income receipt are not universally health promoting, but on balance there are more health benefits than detriments.},

	abstract = {Objective
To assess the relationship between the presence and generosity of state‐level Earned Income Tax Credits (EITC) and multiple self‐reported measures of general health.

Data Sources
Data on state‐level tax credits and covariates were obtained from the National Bureau of Economic Research and University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research, respectively. These data were merged with Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey records from 1993‐2016.

Study Design
Using difference‐in‐differences approaches and survey‐weighted Poisson regression that accounted for clustering of observations and included state and year fixed‐effects, we assessed relationships between EITC and self‐reported overall health, frequent mental distress, and frequent poor physical health in the prior 30 days. Covariates included state minimum wage, state GDP, and adoption of Medicaid expansion. Sensitivity analyses revealed that parallel trends were plausible; there were no significant lead and lag effects.

Data Extraction Methods
Analyses were restricted to respondents with no more than a high school diploma or equivalent because less‐educated adults are more likely to be low‐wage earners and therefore qualify for EITC.

Principal Findings
Among adults with no education beyond high school (n = 2 884 790), each additional 10‐percentage‐point increase in the generosity of state EITC—relative to the federal credit—was associated with fewer reports of frequent mental distress (−97.3 per 100 000; 95\% CI: −237.2, 42.6) and frequent poor physical health (−149.6 per 100 000; 95\% CI: −284.4, −14.9). When restricted to individuals interviewed during the three months when tax rebates are commonly disbursed, the magnitude of the association between EITC and prevalence of reported frequent mental distress was greater (−329.7 per 100 000; 95\% CI: −636.0, −23.5).

Conclusions
The generosity of state EITC policies is positively associated with significant reductions in frequent mental distress and poor physical health, especially during months when the credit is received. Interventions to reduce poverty may positively impact health by reducing material hardship and stress.},

	abstract = {Out-of-pocket medical expenses are important to study because of their effect on financial burden and potential impact on access to and use of health care.
The level of annual out-of-pocket expenses is affected by several factors, including whether a person is insured, the type of insurance, health status,
frequency of health care use, and types of medical services received. In addition, changes in the health insurance market and in public programs affect
trends in out-of-pocket payments. Since the early 2000s, deductibles and copayments have increased, high-deductible plans have become more frequent, use
of generic drugs has increased, and Medicare Part D legislation and the Affordable Care Act have taken effect. This Statistical Brief presents data from the Household Component of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS-HC) to examine levels of out-of-pocket
payments made by individuals and families for the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population, focusing on those with expenses for health care during
2000 to 2014.1 The estimates exclude spending on health insurance premiums. Three estimates are examined: the percentage of persons with an
out-of-pocket payment among those who had an expense; the out-of-pocket payment as a percentage of a person's expenses; and the average amount paid out
of pocket per person. Estimates are shown separately for the non-elderly and elderly populations and by type of insurance coverage because levels of
out-of-pocket payments vary substantially according to these characteristics. All dollar amounts for 2000 to 2013 are inflated to 2014 dollars. All
differences between estimates discussed in the text are statistically significant at the 0.05 level or better.},

In these models, the demand curve alone can be used to make welfare statements, a fact relied on by much empirical work. There is ample evidence, though, that people misuse care for a different reason: mistakes, or “behavioral hazard.” Much high-value care is underused even when patient costs are low, and some useless care is bought even when patients face the full cost. In the presence of behavioral hazard, welfare calculations using only the demand curve can be off by orders of magnitude or even be the wrong sign. We derive optimal copay formulas that incorporate both moral and behavioral hazard, providing a theoretical foundation for value-based insurance design and a way to interpret behavioral “nudges.” Once behavioral hazard is taken into account, health insurance can do more than just provide financial protection—it can also improve health care efficiency.},

We develop a framework that uses this variation to estimate the relationship between observed mortality rates and causal mortality effects; we find a tight link. We then extend the framework to study other predictors of mortality effects and estimate consumer willingness to pay. Higher spending plans tend to reduce enrollee mortality, but existing quality ratings are uncorrelated with plan mortality effects. Consumers place little weight on mortality effects when choosing plans. Moving beneficiaries out of the bottom 5\% of plans could save tens of thousands of elderly lives each year.},

	url = {http://www.nber.org/papers/w28439.pdf},
	abstract = {We use the design of Medicare’s prescription drug benefit program to demonstrate three facts about the health consequences of cost-sharing. First, we show that an as-if-random increase of 33.6\% in out-of-pocket price (11.0 percentage points (p.p.) change in coinsurance, or \$10.40 per drug) causes a 22.6\% drop in total drug consumption (\$61.20), and a 32.7\% increase in monthly mortality (0.048 p.p.). Second, we trace this mortality effect to cutbacks in life-saving medicines like statins and antihypertensives, for which clinical trials show large mortality benefits. We find no indication that these reductions in demand affect only ‘low-value’ drugs; on the contrary, those at the highest risk of heart attack and stroke, who would benefit the most from statins and antihypertensives, cut back more on these drugs than lower risk patients. Similar patterns exist for other drug–disease pairs, and irrespective of socioeconomic circumstance. Finally, we document that when faced with complex, high-dimensional choice problems, patients respond in simple, perverse ways. Specifically, price increases cause 18.0\% more patients (2.8 p.p.) to fill no drugs, regardless of how many drugs they had been on previously, or their health risks. This decision mechanically results in larger absolute reductions in utilization for those on many drugs. We conclude that cost-sharing schemes should be evaluated based on their overall impact on welfare, which can be very different from the price elasticity of demand.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adherence to medications that are prescribed after myocardial infarction is poor. Eliminating out-of-pocket costs may increase adherence and improve outcomes.
METHODS: We enrolled patients discharged after myocardial infarction and randomly assigned their insurance-plan sponsors to full prescription coverage (1494 plan sponsors with 2845 patients) or usual prescription coverage (1486 plan sponsors with 3010 patients) for all statins, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin-receptor blockers. The primary outcome was the first major vascular event or revascularization. Secondary outcomes were rates of medication adherence, total major vascular events or revascularization, the first major vascular event, and health expenditures.
RESULTS: Rates of adherence ranged from 35.9 to 49.0\% in the usual-coverage group and were 4 to 6 percentage points higher in the full-coverage group (P{\textless}0.001 for all comparisons). There was no significant between-group difference in the primary outcome (17.6 per 100 person-years in the full-coverage group vs. 18.8 in the usual-coverage group; hazard ratio, 0.93; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 1.04; P=0.21). The rates of total major vascular events or revascularization were significantly reduced in the full-coverage group (21.5 vs. 23.3; hazard ratio, 0.89; 95\% CI, 0.90 to 0.99; P=0.03), as was the rate of the first major vascular event (11.0 vs. 12.8; hazard ratio, 0.86; 95\% CI, 0.74 to 0.99; P=0.03). The elimination of copayments did not increase total spending (\$66,008 for the full-coverage group and \$71,778 for the usual-coverage group; relative spending, 0.89; 95\% CI, 0.50 to 1.56; P=0.68). Patient costs were reduced for drugs and other services (relative spending, 0.74; 95\% CI, 0.68 to 0.80; P{\textless}0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The elimination of copayments for drugs prescribed after myocardial infarction did not significantly reduce rates of the trial's primary outcome. Enhanced prescription coverage improved medication adherence and rates of first major vascular events and decreased patient spending without increasing overall health costs.

	abstract = {Background Adherence to medications that are prescribed after myocardial infarction is poor. Eliminating out-of-pocket costs may increase adherence and improve outcomes.
Methods We enrolled patients discharged after myocardial infarction and randomly assigned their insurance-plan sponsors to full prescription coverage (1494 plan sponsors with 2845 patients) or usual prescription coverage (1486 plan sponsors with 3010 patients) for all statins, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting–enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin-receptor blockers. The primary outcome was the first major vascular event or revascularization. Secondary outcomes were rates of medication adherence, total major vascular events or revascularization, the first major vascular event, and health expenditures.
Results Rates of adherence ranged from 35.9 to 49.0\% in the usual-coverage group and were 4 to 6 percentage points higher in the full-coverage group (P{\textless}0.001 for all comparisons). There was no significant between-group difference in the primary outcome (17.6 per 100 person-years in the full-coverage group vs. 18.8 in the usualcoverage group; hazard ratio, 0.93; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 1.04; P = 0.21).

	abstract = {Employees face an increasing financial burden for health services as health care costs increase relative to earnings. Yet little is known about health care utilization patterns relative to employee wages. To better understand this association and the resulting implications, we examined patterns of health care use and spending by wage category during 2014 among 42,936 employees of four self-insured employers enrolled in a private health insurance exchange. When demographics and other characteristics were controlled for, employees in the lowest-wage group had half the usage of preventive care (19 percent versus 38 percent), nearly twice the hospital admission rate (31 individuals per 1,000 versus 17 per 1,000), more than four times the rate of avoidable admissions (4.3 individuals per 1,000 versus 0.9 per 1,000), and more than three times the rate of emergency department visits (370 individuals per 1,000 versus 120 per 1,000) relative to top-wage-group earners. Annual total health care spending per patient was highest in both the lowest-wage (\$4,835) and highest-wage (\$5,074) categories relative to the middle two wage groups (\$3,952 and \$3,987, respectively). These findings provide new insights about wage-associated variations in health care use and spending in employer-sponsored plans. For policy makers, these findings can inform employer benefit design strategies and research priorities, to encourage effective use of health care services.},

	abstract = {Because employer-sponsored health insurance (ESI) is experience rated, employers have an incentive to try to offset its cost by paying lower wages to employees who have greater medical expenditures. The existing evidence on this topic, however, illustrates only that ESI is associated with lower wages for groups of workers who are costlier to cover. In contrast, I use the variation provided by the Affordable Care Act's employer mandate to examine if differences in medical expenditures are passed on to workers at the individual level. My estimates rely on Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data in a dose response difference-in-difference framework that examines how wages change for workers with varying medical expenditures when they must soon be offered ESI. I find that each \$1 difference in medical expenditures is associated with a \$0.35 to \$0.51 wage offset after the employer mandate's announcement wherever ESI must soon be offered to workers. Placebo analyses, focusing on workers whose employers are not affected by the mandate, provide support for a causal interpretation. I also show that my findings are not sensitive to sample selection or data reliability issues and that they cannot be explained by the effects of the Great Recession, demographic characteristics that correlate with medical expenditures, or location- or industry-specific idiosyncratic shocks.},

	abstract = {Health insurance coverage varies substantially between racial and ethnic groups in the United States. Compared to non-Hispanic whites, African Americans and people of Hispanic origin had persistently lower insurance coverage rates at all ages. This article describes age- and group-speciﬁc dynamics of insurance gain and loss that contribute to inequalities found in traditional cross-sectional studies. It uses the longitudinal 2008 Panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (N = 114,345) to describe age-speciﬁc patterns of disparity prior to the Affordable Care Act (ACA). A formal decomposition on increment–decrement life tables of insurance gain and loss shows that coverage disparities are predominately driven by minority groups’ greater propensity to lose the insurance that they already have. Uninsured African Americans were faster to gain insurance compared to non-Hispanic whites, but their high rates of insurance loss more than negated this advantage. Disparities from greater rates of loss among minority groups emerge rapidly at the end of childhood and persist throughout adulthood. This is especially true for African Americans and Hispanics, and their relative disadvantages again heighten in their 40s and 50s.},

The model predicts that consumption tracks income, and the model explains why consumers have asset-specific marginal propensities to consume. The model suggests that financial innovation may have caused the ongoing decline in U. S. savings rates, since financial innovation increases liquidity, eliminating commitment opportunities. Finally, the model implies that financial market innovation may reduce welfare by providing "too much" liquidity.},
